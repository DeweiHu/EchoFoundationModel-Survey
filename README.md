# EchoFoundationModel-Survey
This is an updating literature review of the foundation models for echocardiogram. To enable more potentials for future development, we also include some video-based foundation models from other medical data modalities and natural videos. Currently, we don't consider the multi-modality scenario such as the vision-language model.
